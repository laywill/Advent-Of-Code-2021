# Advent-Of-Code-2021

Advent of Code is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. https://adventofcode.com/2021/

# Codebase

The codebase for this year can be found on GitLab, as I wanted to make use of GitLab CI: https://gitlab.com/laywill/advent-of-code-2021
